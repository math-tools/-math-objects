How to use the tests?
=====================

The following `Python` extra packages are needed (you can use ``pip`` to install them).

  1. **[Hypothesis](http://hypothesis.works)** is used to do property based tests.
  2. **[orPyste](https://github.com/bc-python-tools/orpyste)** is used to work with easy-to-maintain data files.
  3. **[misTool](https://github.com/bc-python-tools/mistool)** allows to use an extended version of  the class `pathlib.Path`.
