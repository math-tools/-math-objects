How to use this factory?
========================

The factory needs all the following packages. You can use ``pip`` to install them.

  1. [misTool](https://pypi.org/project/mistool)

  1. [orPyste](https://pypi.org/project/orpyste)

  1. [cbdevtools](https://pypi.org/project/cbdevtools)


No style of coding
==================

The codes used here can be very ugly (here we just want to do speed coding). Maybe a monkey could do a better job than me...
