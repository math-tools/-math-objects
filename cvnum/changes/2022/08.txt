[[:api:]]
Here are the breaking changes.

    1) The parameter ``nb`` of the method ``textify.integer.IntName.nameof`` has been renamed ``varnb`` to stress the possibility to use legal "integer-string" variables.

    1) Please, do not laugh too loud... The module ``convert.integer.var2int`` with the class ``Var2Int`` has been moved to ``convert.core.var2int``. The aim of the module ``convert.core`` is to propose shared features for conversions.

[[:api:]]
???????
The new implementation of the package ``convert.integer`` has been done following a ¨poo style (it uses the "strict" module ``convert.natural``).


[[:doc:]]
???????
One section explains good practice to report bugs, or to suggest enhancements (it has been also added in the path::``README.md`` file of the project).


    ---> donner canevas de présnetation
    ---> faire la version angalise pour le README

:update:
--------

[[:doc:]]
Here are the changes made.

    ???????
    1) Detailed explanations about the ¨api of the new sub package ``convert``.

    ???????
    1) Comeback of explanations about the possibility to use any legal "integer-string" variable with ``textify.integer.IntName``.


--------
:fordev:
--------

[[:doc:]]
???????
All prototypes are now up to date.


[[:tests:]]
Some new unit tests (with a better covering of all the ¨api).

    1) The new class ``convert.core.var2int.Var2int`` is tested.

    1) Naming integers: new tests added about variables that are convertible to legal "integer-strings".

    1)
    ???????
    ``convert.natural``
    ???????
    and ``convert.integer`` are fully tested (at least randomly).


[[:flow:]]      passer via module vu sur lettre Python???
???????
¨Configs for thef actory folder: one path::``factory/factory.cfg`` file is used to customize the behavior of the factory (this will be used by a ¨git hook ¨bash script to choose the outputs printed by the builders in the terminal). This has implied an update of the project ``cbdevtools`` (all the boring job is done by the package ``????``).

:new:

[[:api:]]
A new class ``convert.natural.Base2Base`` has been added to convert from any base writtings to any other base writtings.

[[:api:]]
One builder builds all the methods of the class ``convert.natural.Base2Base``.

[[:tests:]]
Unit tests: the checker of the symetry of the ¨apis of the classes ``Base2Nat`` and ``Nat2Base`` has been transformed into a more strict test.
