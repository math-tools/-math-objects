Here are the new features to name integers.

    1) Naming integers: the new ¨python ¨api is now "fully functional" (tests will be added soon, so it should remain some insidious bugs).

    1) ¨DSL for translations: the analysis of very big numbers follows a simpler logic. This implies the creation of a new optional key cvnum::``dir`` for the block peuf::``general``.


[[:doc:]]
Naming integers: the new way followed to analyze very big numbers has been explained (¨docs for the users, and the ¨DSL).

[[:bug:]]
Naming integers.

    1) The work on the unit tests has shown that `63,005` was translated into "sixty-three thousand and zero hundred and five" with an unwanted "zero hundred". This has been fixed.

    1) The remove of spaces and decimal separators was not implemented. This has been added.

[[:api:]]
Naming integers: the number to name can be any object with a string representation that is a "legal" integer.


[[:doc:]]
Naming integers: the "kinds" of numbers that can be converted have been documented.


[[:api:]]
¨DSL for translations: a block peuf::``this`` must be used to indicated ¨infos about the translation (see the short ¨desc).

[[:api:]]
Naming integers.

    1) A new translation: the academic French using the convention "hyphens everywhere" has been added.

    1) Tags for ¨langs have been added to avoid typing errors.


--------
:update:
--------

[[:doc:]]
Naming integers: explanations about the tags for ¨langs have been added (all the ¨langs available are automatically indicated in the ¨doc).

:fordev:

[[:api:]]
¨DSL for translations: a short ¨desc, only in english, must be given for all languages (this is used for the technical and the human ¨docs).

[[:api:]]
Naming integers: the conversion from name to integer has been removed because the previous implementation doesn't work with languages like German (this feature should come back later).

[[:api:]]
Configuration file path::``config/detextify/langint.py``: the special constants have different values such as to give specific error messages in case of a bug.
