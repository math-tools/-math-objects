The module ``detextify`` has been renamed ``textify``, and the folder path::``config/detextify`` has become path::``config/textify``.


--------
:update:
--------

[[:bugs:]]
Naming integers: the work on the unit tests has shown the following bugs.

    1) Testing ``fr_FR_tiret`` has shown the need to change the pattern regex::``\S*`` to regex::``[^\s-]*`` (the first one catched the hyphens).
    The fix of this bug has also shown the necessity to build ``self._zerobigname`` differently (see the piece of a rule cvnum::``"[d]- :if: d > 0"``).

    1) Another "stupid" bug fixed: with ``fr_FR``, the integer `5000000000001` was printed "cinq mille milliards zéro million mille un" with an unexpected "zéro million".


[[:api:]]
Contributions.

    1) The folder path::``tools/factory/textify/lang`` has been moved to become path::``contribute/api/textify/lang``.

    1) Creation of the directory path::``contribute/doc`` for the translations of the "human" ¨doc (the ¨lang used for the ¨doc written by the developer is indicated in the file path::``doc/main.txt``)


[[:doc:]]
The following changes have been made.

    1) Folder with the ¨langs supported by the module ``textify``: the new path path::``contribute/api/textify/lang`` has been indicated.

    1) One warning has been added about the new special file path::``FR/FR/usecases/integers/special.txt``.

Semantic coding: ``assert WHAT_IS_WANTED, ERROR_MESSAGE`` is always used instead of something like ``if not WHAT_IS_WANTED: raise Exception(ERROR_MESSAGE)``.

[[:api:]]
¨DSL for translations.

    1) It is now possible to chain extensions of ¨langs (this has allowed to simplify the definition of ``fr_FR_chuquet_1`` by using ``fr_FR_chuquet_2``, this last one being an extension of ``fr_FR``).

    1) The possibility to forbid naming of very big numbers was a missing feature. This has been added (it is used by the ¨langs ``fr_FR_chuquet_1``, ``fr_FR_chuquet_2`` and ``fr_FR_rowlett``).

    1) For the signs, it is possible to indicate a pattern to follow (this has been used to complete the ¨lang ``fr_FR_tiret``).

[[:bugs:]]
Naming integers: the work on the unit tests has shown the following bugs that have been fixed.

    1) `400,000` was translated into "four hundred thousand zero" with an unwanted "zero" at the end.

    1) `200_000*10**18` was translated into "two hundred thousand" with the ¨lang ``en_GB``, but "deux cent mille milliards de milliards" with the ¨lang ``fr_FR`` as expected. The bug was also met with the ¨langs ``de_DE``, ``en_US`` and ``it_IT``. That was so violent! :-)

[[:api:]]
Here are the changes.

    1) ¨DSL for translations: extended ¨langs can have their own patches.

    1) The file path::``convert.base2dec`` and path::``convert.dec2base`` have been renamed path::``convert.base2int`` and path::``convert.int2base``.


[[:doc:]]
¨DSL for translations.

    1) Some important clarifications have been made about extensions of ¨langs.

    1) Some rules and conventions must be followed to write usecases.

Here are the new features to name integers.

    1) Naming integers: the new ¨python ¨api is now "fully functional" (tests will be added soon, so it should remain some insidious and serious bugs).

    1) ¨DSL for translations: the analysis of very big numbers follows a simpler logic. This implies the creation of a new optional key cvnum::``dir`` for the block peuf::``general``.


[[:doc:]]
Naming integers: the new way used to analyze very big numbers has been explained (¨docs for the users, and also for the ¨DSL).

[[:bugs:]]
Naming integers.

    1) The work on the unit tests has shown that `63,005` was translated into "sixty-three thousand and zero hundred and five" with an unwanted "zero hundred". This has been fixed.

    1) The remove of spaces and decimal separators was not implemented. This has been added.

Naming integers: the number to name can be any object with a string representation that is a "legal" integer.


[[:doc:]]
Naming integers: the "kinds" of numbers that can be converted have been documented.


[[:api:]]
¨DSL for translations: a block peuf::``this`` must be used to indicated ¨infos about the translation (see the short ¨desc).

Naming integers.

    1) A new translation: the academic French using the convention "hyphens everywhere" has been added.

    1) Tags for ¨langs have been added to avoid typing errors.


--------
:update:
--------

[[:doc:]]
Naming integers: explanations about the tags for ¨langs have been added (all the ¨langs available are automatically indicated in the ¨doc).

:fordev:

[[:api:]]
¨DSL for translations: a short ¨desc, only in english, must be given for all languages (this is used for the technical and the human ¨docs).

[[:api:]]
Naming integers: the conversion from name to integer has been removed because the previous implementation doesn't work with languages like German (this feature should come back later).

[[:api:]]
Configuration file path::``config/detextify/langint.py``: the special constants have different values such as to give specific error messages in case of a bug.
